                <p>Another very imporant aspect of the site is how it was made. Below is just some information on things like what tools where used, where all this data is coming from and more.</p>

                <h1>Vue</h1>
                <p> Horizons Library is a front end website made with Vue.js and deployed on the web PaSS Heroku. Having built websites with React and vanilla HTML/CSS, I was curious to try the newer and different framework. It provided a lightweight and easy to use template, as well as Bootstrap Vue to make your site mobile responsive and aesthitcally pleasing. One simple but useful component that stands out to me personally using Vue.js is the v-for directive. Having to list the large amount of Animal Crossing data is made easy and completed quickly.</p>
